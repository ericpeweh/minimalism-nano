		content:
			"Live a simple life, nothing should force you to do something, and no one should tell you to be something. Build your own castle, make it as comfy as you can. So if one in a while you are sad, you already have a quiet place to rest to take break from bitter truth."

		title: "Best things in life aren't a things.",
		content:
			"All things that shine attract us to get and collect one. All things with good color attract us to buy one. There is nothing simpler than a minimalist, get things you can't buy with money. Things will age and decay, but memories will last forever. At least, as long as you can remember."

			"Don't rush your life, life is not a race. Your starting line can be different from others, so can your finish line. You deserve to have time to enjoy your life, life is not about OTHER people. But life is about YOU facing the world."
